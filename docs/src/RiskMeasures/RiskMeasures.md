# Risk Measures

Risk measures are the backbone of portfolio optimisation. They allow for the quantification of risk in different ways. This section describes the various risk measures included in [`PortfolioOptimiser`](https://github.com/dcelisgarza/PortfolioOptimiser.jl), explains their properties, formulations and compatibility with the various optimisation types in the library.

## Specifying solvers

Some risk measures require solvers to compute the risk measure via [`calc_risk`](@ref). When using high level functions that take in an instance of [`Portfolio`](@ref) as an argument, the solvers will be taken from it. However, it is possible to override them by directly providing the solvers to the risk measure instance.

The solvers can be specified by any container which implements the [`AbstractDict`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Base.AbstractDict) interfaces. This dictionary must contain key-value pairs for all solvers one wants to use. The key can be of any type, but the value must be a dictionary with the following key-value pairs.

  - `:solver`: defines the solver to be used. One can also use [`JuMP.optimizer_with_attributes`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#optimizer_with_attributes) to direcly provide a solver with attributes already attached.
  - `:check_sol`: (optional) defines the keyword arguments passed on to [`JuMP.is_solved_and_feasible`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#is_solved_and_feasible) for accepting/rejecting solutions.
  - `:params`: (optional) defines solver-specific parameters/attributes.
  - `:add_bridges`: (optional) value of the `add_bridges` kwarg of [`JuMP.set_optimizer`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#JuMP.set_optimizer), if not provided defaults to `true`.

```@example solvers_dict
using JuMP, Clarabel
solvers = Dict(
               # Key-value pair for the solver, solution acceptance 
               # criteria, model bridge argument, and solver attributes.
               :Clarabel => Dict(
                                 # Solver we wish to use.
                                 :solver => Clarabel.Optimizer,
                                 # (Optional) Solution acceptance criteria.
                                 :check_sol => (allow_local = true, allow_almost = true),
                                 # (Optional) Solver-specific attributes.
                                 :params => Dict("verbose" => false),
                                 # (Optional) Flag for adding JuMP bridges to JuMP.Model()
                                 # defaults to true (https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/api/JuMP/#Model).
                                 :add_bridges => false))
```

Users are able to provide multiple solvers by adding additional key-value pairs to the top-level dictionary as in the following snippet.

```@example solvers_dict
solvers = Dict(:Clarabel_1 => Dict(:solver => Clarabel.Optimizer,
                                   :check_sol => (allow_local = true, allow_almost = true),
                                   :params => Dict("verbose" => false)),
               # Provide solver with pre-attached attributes and no arguments 
               # for the `JuMP.is_solved_and_feasible` function.
               :Clarabel_2 => Dict(:solver => JuMP.optimizer_with_attributes(Clarabel.Optimizer,
                                                                             "max_step_fraction" => 0.75),
                                   # Do not add JuMP bridges to JuMP.Model()
                                   :add_bridges => false))
```

[`PortfolioOptimiser`](https://github.com/dcelisgarza/PortfolioOptimiser.jl) will iterate over the solvers until it finds the first one to successfully solve the problem. If a deterministic ordering is desired (for example when going from relaxed to strict tolerances), use an [`OrderedDict`](https://juliacollections.github.io/OrderedCollections.jl/dev/ordered_containers/#OrderedDicts).

## Abstract types

[`PortfolioOptimiser`](https://github.com/dcelisgarza/PortfolioOptimiser.jl/)'s risk measures are implemented using Julia's type hierarchy. This makes it easy to add new ones by implementing the relevant types and methods.

```@docs
PortfolioOptimiser.AbstractRiskMeasure
RiskMeasure
HCRiskMeasure
NoOptRiskMeasure
```

## Settings

[`PortfolioOptimiser`](https://github.com/dcelisgarza/PortfolioOptimiser.jl/) lets users provide multiple risk measures at the same time. They can be added to the risk expression in the optimisation objective, or used to set upper risk bounds. If multiple risk measures are to be used as part of the risk expression in the optimisation objective, it makes sense provide a way to scale each risk contribution in the objective, especially because different risk expressions may have different units, and therefore require appropriate scaling.

Furthermore, certain risk measures make use of Ordered Weight Array formulations, for which there is an expensive exact formulation, and an approximate, tunable one. We let users decide which one to use, and if they want to use the approximate one they can tune it as they see fit.

The following structures provide said functionality.
